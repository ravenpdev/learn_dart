#### Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Column2                 | Column3 |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------- |
| +        | addition                | 1+2     |
| -        | substraction            | 2-2     |
| \*       | multiplication          | 2\*2    |
| /        | division (double)       | 2/2     |
| ~/       | division (int)          | 2~/2    |
| %        | modulo (residual value) | 42 % 4  |

#### Lists & Arrays

- Arrays are like variables that can hold multiple values
- Data structure
- Specific values can be accessed via index

| value | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| index | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |

#### Maps

- Data structure with key-value pairs
- The access to a value is done via the corresponding key

| Key       | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| "key1"    | 2     |
| "key2"    | 3     |
| "key3"    | 6     |
| "key4"    | 4     |
| "someKey" | 9     |

#### Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description              | Example                  |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| <        | Less than                | 1 < 2 true               |
| >        | Greater than             | 1 > 2 false              |
| <=       | Less than or equal to    | 1 <= 1 true 0 <= 1 true  |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to | 1 >= 1 true 0 >= 1 false |
| ==       | Equal                    | 1==1 true                |
| !=       | Not equal                | 1!=1 false 1!=2 true     |
