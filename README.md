#### Lists & Arrays

- Arrays are like variables that can hold multiple values
- Data structure
- Specific values can be accessed via index

| value | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| index | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |

#### Maps

- Data structure with key-value pairs
- The access to a value is done via the corresponding key

| Key       | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| "key1"    | 2     |
| "key2"    | 3     |
| "key3"    | 6     |
| "key4"    | 4     |
| "someKey" | 9     |
